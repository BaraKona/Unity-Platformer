// Story
Cubeheads hate curves or anything that isn’t a straight line or angle  
Lilsno is the most powerful rounded object in the world
They attempted to kill him but couldn’t because he was too strong
Lilsno posed the most challenge to the cuboid empire
They put him in a coma and made him pixelated to reduce the curvature
